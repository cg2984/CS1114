This is a test file to see if I can finall use Git Bash like a normal human
being. Let's see if this shit finally works out. Then I can link all of my
things between desktops and stuff I think. I'm not completley sure. But, I will not be losing homework like I have done in the past, or have late versions of 
homework, hopefully.
